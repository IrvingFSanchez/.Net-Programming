## 🛠️ Projects

### 1. **Shape Calculator**

- **Description**: A C# console application that calculates the volume of a cube and a sphere based on user input. It also displays a formatted banner and handles invalid input gracefully.
- **Features**:
  - 🎨 Custom banner with centered text.
  - 🔢 Input validation for numeric values.
  - 📐 Volume calculations for cubes and spheres.
  - 📊 Total volume calculation and display.
- **Technologies Used**: C#, .NET, Console Application.
- **How to Run**:
  1. Clone the repository.
  2. Navigate to the `ShapeCalculator` folder.
  3. Run the program using `dotnet run`. (Ensure you have .NET installed on your hardware).

### 2. **Polynomial Calculator**

- **Description**: A C# console application that calculates the values of polynomial functions (up to degree 3) over a specified domain. It allows users to input coefficients, domain ranges, and displays the polynomial's values in a tabulated format.
- **Features**:
  - 🎨 Custom banner with centered text.
  - ✔️ Input validation for degree, coefficients, and domain values.
  - 📊 Tabulated output of polynomial values over the domain.
  - 🔄 Ability to compute multiple polynomials in one session.
  - 🪄 Automatic swapping of `minX` and `maxX` if `minX > maxX`.
- **Technologies Used**: C#, .NET, Console Application.
- **How to Run**:
  1. Clone the repository.
  2. Navigate to the `PolynomialCalculator` folder.
  3. Run the program using `dotnet run`. (Ensure you have .NET installed on your hardware).

### 3. **Storefront**

- **Description**: A C# console application that simulates a storefront where users can purchase items from an inventory loaded from a text file. The program allows users to add items to their cart, specify quantities, and calculates the total cost at checkout.
- **Features**:
  - 🎨 Custom banner with centered text.
  - 📚 Automatically reads inventory from a text file (`Storefront.txt`).
  - 🛒 Allows users to add items to their cart and update quantities.
  - ✅ Input validation for item names and quantities.
  - 🧾 Displays a sorted list of purchased items and the total cost.
- **Technologies Used**: C#, .NET, Console Application, File I/O.
- **How to Run**:
  1. Clone the repository.
  2. Navigate to the `Storefront/Storefront` folder.
  3. Ensure the `Storefront.txt` file is in the same folder as the program but also put it in the bin/debug/netx.x folder just in case.
  4. Run the program using `dotnet run`. (Ensure you have .NET installed on your hardware).
