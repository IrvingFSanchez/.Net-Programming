    =============================================
    VIEW START CONFIGURATION
    =============================================
    This file runs automatically before ANY view renders.
    Its primary purpose is to set the default layout template.
    
    You could think of it as your "set it and forget it" configuration
    that ensures consistency across all pages.
    -Sets _Layout.cshtml as the default template for all views
    -Views can override this by specifying their own Layout
*@

@{

    Layout = "_Layout";
}

@* 
    =============================================
    KEY POINTS:
    1. Executes before each view renders
    2. Centralizes layout configuration
    3. Can be overridden per-view when needed
    
    Example override in a view:
    @@{
        Layout = "_AlternateLayout"; // Uses different template
    }

    Just a small little useful gee-wiz thing I also did not know.

@* Note to self, using the '@symbol with * and ending with * @' allows you to make comments to your HTML 
without it ever showing up on the browser side 'client side' but can show up on the 'server', it stays hidden. Did...not...know....that....
